# Nuclear Fission Simulation

A simulation of nuclear fission events, designed to track and visualize the fission of atomic 
nuclei and the resulting chain reaction. The project combines C++ for high-speed computation of 
fission events and Python for real-time animation of neutron paths and nuclear fragments.
